## What is Wife Change Dao and why should you care?

Wife Change DAO (WCD) is a community that is founded by a group people who's only common interest is to make wife-changing amount of money. The Wife Change Money (WCM) token will be the first product of the WCD. 

## What is Wife Change Money and what are its fundamentals?
WCD will be released as a vanilla ERC20 token on the Binance Smart Chain. There is no fundamentals as WCD is not a security, and no financial advice should ever be made to buy and hold it. There is no ponzi mechanic to support its price nor fancy functionalities that makes it a passive income source. It is a plain shitcoin. 

However if you do feel like trading a commodity with TA, you can perfect trade with a peace of mind due to its fair launch nature. Maybe the project fails and everyone has sold. The price is depressed and stays depressed for very long time. Maybe everyone in the DAO has forgetten about it and no longer delivers the roadmap. One thing is certain, I will not one day show up and mint a shit tons of it and dump on you due to its fair launch nature. 

## What do I mean by 'Fair Launch'?

WCD will launch on PancakeSwap on BSC. The entire supply will be matched with a inital liquidity (USD or BNB or BTCB). The liquidity will be from the DAO members who contribute something to the project other than money (time, expertise, or other useful resources). The LP token will be locked away for either forever or multiple years. If it is the former, then the LP token will be burned by sending to the blackhole address, and the transaction id will be published for everyone to verify. If it is the latter then the LP token will be locked in a open-sourced contract for everyone to monitor and verify. The BEP20 token's admin key will be burned at the best convenience. 

It is fair for several reasons:

1. No one other than whoever control the BSC chain can do anything to stop it. If the founder is arrested and tortured, he wouldn't take your coins because the admin key is burned.
2. Even though the genesis liquidity is entirely divided by the genesis liquidity sponsors, the sponsors only have limited upside. As the price of the coin goes up, their LPs will suffer impermanant loss. And anyone is free to provide LP, their share in the pool will certainly diminish. 
3. In order to sustain their upside, even the earliest adopters have to buy just like everyone else. Even through the token itself is a social coordination mechanism, the early adopters buying the coin also face the Byzantine General dillemma: how do they trust each other to not dump on each other? How can they be sure the project will success and they don't lose money by holding a useless token? The answer is there isn't any mechanism built to coordinate. They will have to stomach the risk just like everyone else. 

## Roadmap

Like many other shitcoins, as a community we has a roadmap. The bottomline is that the WCM is the Wife Change DAO's ecosystem's money.

0.0 Wife Change DAO formulation

0.1 Wife Change Money token launch

1.0 WifeSwap Dex launch.
	* Another shitcoin Wife Swap Token (WST) will be launched to help bootstrap the liquidity. 
	* A portion of the trading fee will be rewarded to WST holder.
	* 10% of the trading fee will be used to for provisioning of the WCM liquidity (protocol controled liquidity). This will be permanantly locked. 
	
2.0 Fart protocol launch
	* Fart is a OlympusDAO clone. Its native token is called FART.
	* The rule is exactly the same as OHM. Exactly like OHM, FART is a shit shit coin and ought to be dumped into oblivian. But anyone is welcome to farm the cosmic yield.
	* the official liquidity of FART will be WCM. The bond will be offered in FART-WCM LP tokens.
	* Initial distribution of the FART tokens will be offered in WCM.
	* 10% of the Fart protocol income will be used to for provisioning of the WCM liquidity.
